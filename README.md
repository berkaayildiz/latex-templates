# LaTeX Templates

This repository contains a collection of LaTeX document templates for various use cases. These templates aim to provide a starting point for creating well-formatted documents with ease.

## Usage

If you have LaTeX installed, you can clone this repository and use the templates as you wish. If you don't have LaTeX installed, you can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to edit the templates online.

## Templates

Templates from this repository generally includes a real-world example document and a template file. The template file is the one that you should use to create your own document. The example document is there to show you how the template can be used. Here is a brief description and preview of each template:

### Lab Report

This template is designed for writing lab reports as the name suggests. The title page includes the purpose and introduction part by default but it can be modified. You can add extra sections and subsections as needed with ease. The template uses BibTeX for references and the bibliography is automatically generated.

The current version of the example is the report of the 3rd experiment I made for the course "BBM233: Logic Design Laboratory" at Hacettepe University. Here is a preview of the document, you can also check the [PDF](files/lab-report/BBM233_EXPERIMENT_3.pdf):
